In elastic network models, protein structures are simplified by considering only the α-carbon atoms of the protein structure. Thus each residue is represented by its α-carbon atom. Let's look at the example of pyruvate kinase structure. 


```@raw html
<div id="container-01" class="mol-container" style="width:540px;height:540px;position:relative;"></div>
<script>let viewer;let element = $('#container-01');let config = { backgroundColor: 'white' };viewer = $3Dmol.createViewer( element, config );viewer.addSphere({ center: {x:0, y:0, z:0}, radius: 10.0, color: 'green' });viewer.zoomTo();viewer.render();viewer.zoom(0.8, 2000);</script>
```
